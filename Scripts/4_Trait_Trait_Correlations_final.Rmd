title: "PGLS Trait-Trait Correlations"
output: html_notebook
---
# Introduction

The purpose of this notebook is to run pgls trait-trait correlations and visualise the outputs. It requires that a phylogentic tree and trait-dataset in wide-format be already made and supplied. This script creates one of the two networks that comprise Figure 4 of the manuscript (the comparison of networks summarising trait correlation strengths calculated using PGLS vs. OLS analysis), though that figure is not combined in full until the following notebook '5' as well as extracting the raw data for each pgls correlation calculated and presented in supplementary Table S7.2.

Throughout the plotting section of this notebook in the latter half, alternate versions of certain plots can be created and exported if desired by un-commenting certain lines of code. However, the minimum code required to generate the data for Figures and supplementary table will run as is.

# Required Packages, Functions, and Data

```{r}
# Packages
library(ape)
library(ggtree)
library(caper)
library(corrplot)
library(qgraph)
library(plot.matrix)
library(gridExtra)

# Functions

## the following shortcut works better regarding parameters of plotting trees in some cases where plot_dim1 shrinks the tree severely to the left
plot_dim2 <- function(phy) {
  # plots with the correct size text and alignment for 158-225 taxa trees like will be used
  plot(ggtree(phy) +xlim(0, 1.5) + geom_tiplab(size=5)) 
}

## the following is for extracting the calculated r-squared value from a pgls regression model, especially useful when list-applied to many models simultaneously
r_squared <- function(model) {
  x <- summary(model)
  x$r.squared
}

## the following allows extraction of the slope coefficient of a pgls regression model, especially useful when list-applied to a large number of models simlutaneously
extract_slope <- function(model) {
  x <- summary(model)
  x$coefficients[2,1]
}

## the following allows extraction of the lambda values from models (for generating tables of lambda values from trait-correlation models fitted for pairs of variables)
extract_lambda <- function(model){
  x <- model
  lambda <- x$param[2]
  return(lambda)
}

## the following allows extraction of the P-value for the slope coefficient of the independent variable in a bivariate correlation
extract_P <- function(model) {
  x <- summary(model)
  P <- x$coefficients[c(as.character(x$call$formula[[3]])), c('Pr(>|t|)')]
  return(P)
}

## the following allows extraction of the standard error of the slope coefficient for a single independent variable (or maybe the first one mentioned if there are more than one but it is untested in those cases)
extract_SE <- function(model) { 
  x <- summary(model)
  s.e.val <- x$coefficients[c(as.character(x$call$formula[[3]])),c('Std. Error')]
  return(s.e.val)
}

## the following allows extraction of degrees of freedom I.E. NOT SAMPLE SIZE from models (and can be used to extract sample size if we remember to add +1 or +2 to the output accordingly)
extract_n <- function(model) {
  x <- summary(model)
  n <- x$df[[2]]
  return(n)
}

## the following provides a shortcut to rounding values to three decimal places
num_round <- function(x){
  x_num <- as.numeric(x)
  out <- round(x_num, 3)
  return(out)
}


# Data import
eucs.data <- read.csv("../Input_data/eucs_data.csv")
eucs.data <- subset(eucs.data, select = -c(X))
eucs.scaled.data <- read.csv("../Input_data/eucs_scaled_data.csv")
eucs.scaled.data <- subset(eucs.scaled.data, select = -c(X))

# Importing phylogenetic tree
tree <- read.tree("../Input_data/final_tree.txt")
```



# Analysis

## Data Preparation

```{r fig.width = 15, fig.height = 25}
# First to get the imported phylogeny into correct form for joining with trait data
## remove some erroneous node labels that cause issues later in case they appear
tree$node.label <- NULL
## converts tip names back into space-separated rather than underscore (the default when reading from newick format)
tree$tip.label <- gsub("_", " ", tree$tip.label)
## trees require branch lengths for analysis, this method generates them from topology-only trees allowing us to calculate genetic closeness between taxa based on the number of nodes from the root they share instead of using the length of branches, which has been removed as part of the tree-building process anyway
tree <- compute.brlen(tree, method = "Grafen", power = 1)
# just to check that the tree looks normal and like what we expect it to
plot_dim2(tree)


# Preparing the matching objects that allow the package to link data frames to tree tips

## for the untransformed data in case we want to use it
eucs.obj <- comparative.data(phy = tree, data = eucs.data, names.col = taxon, vcv = TRUE, na.omit = FALSE, warn.dropped = TRUE)
eucs.obj$dropped$unmatched.rows # the only unmatched taxa are: E. bunyip and E. carolaniae, E. dendromorpha and E. robusta, and Tristaniopsis laurina
eucs.obj$dropped$tips #none as no tips on the tree are redundant
# 
# ## for the log-transformed data in case we want to use it
# eucs.log.obj <- eucs.log.obj <- comparative.data(phy = tree, data = eucs.log.data, names.col = taxon, vcv = TRUE, na.omit = FALSE, warn.dropped = TRUE)
# eucs.log.obj$dropped$unmatched.rows 

## for the scaled data, which we use almost exclusively
eucs.scaled.obj <- comparative.data(phy = tree, data = eucs.scaled.data, names.col = taxon, vcv = TRUE, na.omit = FALSE, warn.dropped = TRUE)
eucs.scaled.obj$dropped$unmatched.rows
```

```

So it appears that leaf mass and the reproductive traits are all positively correlated. This makes sense if we think of corner's rules (i.e. the relationships between leaf mass and fruit mass due to them being supported by the same branches with the same mechanical limitations on the size of appendage they can support) and, since the reproductive traits are all strongly correlated to one another, the correlation LM experiences with the other reproductive traits can be safely thought of as a residual correlation. Similar residual correlation can be thought of between leaf area and the reproductive traits, since leaf area is strongly correlated to leaf mass because both traits are measures of leaf size.


Are there any correlations for which the calculated lambda value is not significantly different from 0 or 1?

### Lignotuber-Only vs. everything else

Here we are going to fit linear models with the independent variable being the categorical of post-fire regeneration strategy (initially 1 = Lignotuber-Only resprouters and 0 = all other known resprouting categories (Combination Resprouter, Stem-Only Resprouter, and Obligate Seeder)). The boxplots of all 4 categories in the supplementary material (supplementary Figure S2) of the manuscript suggest that, at least for the traits where there was significant differences between categories, Lignotuber-Only Resprouting is more different to the other three categories than those categories are to each other. Values of 1 and 0 were scaled to 1.73 and -0.57 respectively before analysis as this re-scales the slope, which we use later in figure 5 to make the tile diagram of change in slope from OLS to PGLS models, back into a similar range as the rest of the models shown in that diagram. It shouldn't affect the r-value or p-value though.

The following pgls models can only be fit with the continuous variable being the dependent variable as lambda cannot be calculated for categorical variables using this package/functions/method/code. Hence, we can only run the variable in a single configuration on the axes, instead of running it an rerunning after swapping which variable is the (in)dependent variable and taking the configuration with the higher lambda calculated. This doesn't seem like it is an issue as we only did that to be most conservative, but it's an optional level of conservative inspired by the fact that having different values for parameters disrupts plotting and summary analyses. Having it only work one way therefore seems perfectly acceptable.

#### Checking effect of scaling the categories


```{r}
# just to check that the same r-value and p-value are indeed calculated regardless of the scaling factor

eucs.scaled.data.test <- eucs.scaled.data
eucs.scaled.data.test$LO2[eucs.scaled.data.test$LO2 == unique(eucs.scaled.data$LO2)[[2]] & !is.na(eucs.scaled.data.test$LO2)] <- 1
eucs.scaled.data.test$LO2[eucs.scaled.data.test$LO2 == unique(eucs.scaled.data$LO2)[[1]] & !is.na(eucs.scaled.data.test$LO2)] <- 0

eucs.scaled.obj.test <- comparative.data(phy = tree, data = eucs.scaled.data.test, names.col = taxon, vcv = TRUE, na.omit = FALSE, warn.dropped = TRUE)

summary(max.height.LO)
summary(pgls(max_height_m ~ LO2, data = eucs.scaled.obj.test, lambda = 'ML'))
```

It appears we can verify that the scaling factor does not change the r-squared, adjusted-r-squared, p-value or lambda, and it scales the slope and its standard error by exactly the expected amount (here we went from 0-2 to 0-1 and the slope and its standard error doubled).


 

## Extracting Coefficients from PGLS Models

Subsequent plotting/visualisation of the above analysis requires that models combined into a single object and pseudo-r2, pseudo-r, and slope coefficients extracted.

In order to create a data frame of every model we want to represent in our 11 x 11 table, we need to find a model to stand in for the main diagonal elements (traits correlated with themselves) that would have a coefficient of 1.00 and an r-squared of 1.00 also. We only need a single model for this and we can recycle this object for every trait's perfect fit with itself, since the results would be the same regardless of the trait being considered.
 
```{r}
# to regress a variable with itself, it needs to be regressed against another variable with a different name but the same data points, since the regression functions used here don't allow the regression of variables with the same name
eucs.scaled.data.doubled <- cbind(eucs.scaled.data, eucs.scaled.data[c("max_height_m", "relative_height_by_girth", "stem_density_g_per_ml", "relative_bt_by_girth", "sla_mm2_per_mg", "leaf_area_cm2", "leaf_mass_g", "fruit_mass_mg", "fruit_wall_width_mm", "seed_mass_mg")])

# now to rename the columns
names(eucs.scaled.data.doubled) <- c("taxon", "location", "second_location", "max_height_m", "relative_height_by_girth", "stem_density_g_per_ml", "relative_bt_by_girth", "sla_mm2_per_mg", "leaf_area_cm2", "leaf_mass_g", "fruit_mass_mg", "fruit_wall_width_mm", "seed_mass_mg", "Sprouter", "Stem_Sprouter", "Lignotuber_Sprouter", "Stem_Sprouter2", "Lignotuber_Only", "Sprouting_Type", "Sprouting_Type2", "Sprouting_Type3", "Sprouting_Type4", "LO2", "Sieberi", "max_height_m2", "relative_height_by_girth2", "stem_density_g_per_ml2", "relative_bt_by_girth2", "sla_mm2_per_mg2", "leaf_area_cm22", "leaf_mass_g2", "fruit_mass_mg2", "fruit_wall_width_mm2", "seed_mass_mg2")  

# now need to run models of variables against themselves so that r-squared (and slope coefficient) can be 1 and can be placed in the list wherever required
perfect.fit <- lm(max_height_m ~ max_height_m2, data = eucs.scaled.data.doubled)
summary(perfect.fit)
```


Now to make the data-frame/matrix of all models in order to extract the coefficients.

```{r}
# the following first makes a list of all models with the same dependent variable, then construct a larger list of these smaller lists
mh.list <- list(perfect.fit, max.height.rh, max.height.std, max.height.bark, max.height.sla, max.height.lfa, max.height.lms, max.height.fwl, max.height.fms, max.height.sms, max.height.LO)

seed.mass.list <- list(seed.mass.mh, seed.mass.rh, seed.mass.std, seed.mass.bark, seed.mass.sla, seed.mass.lfa, seed.mass.lms, seed.mass.fwl, seed.mass.fms, perfect.fit, seed.mass.LO)

traits.list <- list(mh.list, rh.list, stem.density.list, bark.list, sla.list, leaf.area.list, leaf.mass.list, fruit.wall.list, fruit.mass.list, seed.mass.list, LO.list)

# save this list object so that the above computationally intense code for running the pgls analyses does not need to be run more than once
save(traits.list, file = '../Input_data/pgls_models_list.rda')
```


Now to Extract the pseudo-r-squared (PGLS is a type of GLS model for which r is not concretely defined or comparable to the r-squared of OLS models) to arrive at the pseudo-r-value by taking the square root and assigning a negative sign to those relationships where the slope coefficient (here 'c') is negative.

```{r}
# read back in the object containing the list of models. This method of loading the object back in will preserve the original object name 'traits.list' despite the file name being different
load("../Input_data/pgls_models_list.rda")

# apply the custom function for extraction of r-squared values to all models
full.list <- lapply(traits.list, function(model.list){
  unlist(lapply(model.list, r_squared))
})

# create a data frame of a 11 x 11 table of all r-values, here the dependent variables are the columns
matrix.table.r2 <- data.frame('MH' = full.list[[1]], 'RH' = full.list[[2]], 'SD' = full.list[[3]], 'RBT' = full.list[[4]], 'SLA' = full.list[[5]], 'LA' = full.list[[6]], 'LM' = full.list[[7]], 'FWW' = full.list[[8]], 'FM' = full.list[[9]], 'SM' = full.list[[10]], 'BOS' = full.list[[11]])

# taking the square root of the r-squared to get the equivalent of Pearson's correlation coefficient
matrix.table.r <- as.data.frame(lapply(matrix.table.r2, sqrt))

# NOTE: the BOS trait in the final row/column is mirrored and equal

# now to make sure that the signs of the correlation coefficients are correct by building similar data frame but with slope coefficients and later determine which r-values should be negative

## applying a similar custom function but for extracting slope coefficients this time
full.list.coeff <- lapply(traits.list, function(model.list){
  unlist(lapply(model.list, extract_slope))
})

## creating a data frame for an 11 x 11 table of all slope coefficients, here the dependent variables are still the columns as for the r-table above
matrix.table.c <- data.frame('MH' = full.list.coeff[[1]], 'RH' = full.list.coeff[[2]], 'SD' = full.list.coeff[[3]], 'RBT' = full.list.coeff[[4]], 'SLA' = full.list.coeff[[5]], 'LA' = full.list.coeff[[6]], 'LM' = full.list.coeff[[7]], 'FWW' = full.list.coeff[[8]], 'FM' = full.list.coeff[[9]], 'SM' = full.list.coeff[[10]], 'BOS' = full.list.coeff[[11]])

## creating a logical that is TRUE whever the slope is negative and FALSE everywhere else
neg.slopes <- matrix.table.c < 0
sum(neg.slopes)

# applying the pattern of negative correlations to the r-values themselves
matrix.table.r[neg.slopes] <- matrix.table.r[neg.slopes]*-1

# now the dependent variables are the rows and the independent variables are the columns
matrix.table.r <- t(matrix.table.r)

# converting transposed data frame to matrix format and assigning rownames
matrix.r <- as.matrix(matrix.table.r)
colnames(matrix.r) <- rownames(matrix.table.r)
```

# Plots

The following sections employ various plotting techniques to visualise different results of the above analysis. The vast majorit of which are for interest only and not necessary for the creation of Figure 4 of the manuscript, or intermediates in the decision making on the format of the final figure.

## Raw Data Plots

### Ellipse Table

Note this is not the plot we use in supplementary figure S7 as for that we use the OLS summary rather than the following PGLS version of it, though the two are not particularly different in this case. The OLS version is just simpler and more commonly understood and reported.

```{r}
corrplot(matrix.r, method = "ellipse") #with pgls r-values

# The following lines are optional ways to export this table if so desired
# pdf('pgls_ellipse_table.pdf')
# corrplot(matrix.r, method = "ellipse")
# mtext(text = "Dependent Variable", side = 2, line = 1)
# mtext(text = "Independent Variable", side = 3, line = 1)
# dev.off()
```



### Network Diagram

Shows the trait-relationships as a network or connected traits using just the raw output of r-values extracted above.

```{r}
qgraph(matrix.r, layout = 'spring', label.cex = 0.9, label.scale = FALSE)
```

Since the results for the parameters of the pgls models differ depending on which variable is considered to be the dependent and which the independent variable, when we extract the pseudo-r2 (and also the slope coefficients) each pair of traits has two sets of parameters describing their relationship. This is likely the reason for this network diagram having twice as many lines as intended with two lines for each pairwise comparison of traits instead of one.

Hence, we need to choose a single model for each pairwise comparison so there are only one set of parameters and only a single line for the network diagram so it can be compared to the non-pgls diagram later. This will likely be done based on lambda value.

### Lambda Matrix Plot

Either way, it will be useful to be able to visualise the lambda values in order to see any patterns in them.

```{r, fig.height = 8, fig.width = 10}
# applying the extract_lambda function to a whole data frame of models
full.lambda.list <- lapply(traits.list, function(model.list) {
  lambda.list <- lapply(model.list, extract_lambda)
  lambda.list[unlist(lapply(lambda.list, is.null))] <- NA
  unlist(lambda.list)
})

# creating the lambda matrix, reflecting it to the right way around (dependent variables as row names rather than column names), and inserting placeholder 'low' (zero) lambda values for the BOS section so when we select the ones with the 'highest' lambda it will select the correct ones in the final column and remove all the placeholder rows
lambda.frame <- as.data.frame(full.lambda.list)
colnames(lambda.frame) <- colnames(matrix.table.r2)
lambda.matrix <- as.matrix(lambda.frame)
lambda.matrix <- t(lambda.matrix)
colnames(lambda.matrix) <- rownames(lambda.matrix)
lambda.matrix[rownames(lambda.matrix) == 'BOS', !colnames(lambda.matrix) == 'BOS'] <- 0

# plotting the above with and without the numerical values in each coloured box
par(mar = c(5.1, 4.1, 4.1, 4.1))
plot(lambda.matrix, col = heat.colors(30, rev = TRUE), breaks = 30, na.col= "black", key = list(side = 1, cex.axis = 1.00), fmt.key="%.3f", xlab = "", ylab = "", main = "", axis.col = list(side = 3), fmt.cell='%.3f')
plot(lambda.matrix, col = heat.colors(30, rev = TRUE), breaks = 30, na.col= "black", key = list(side = 1, cex.axis = 1.00), fmt.key="%.3f", xlab = "", ylab = "", main = "", axis.col = list(side = 3))


# NOTE: the following corrplot with just coloured tiles rather than ellipses for the same data has only positive values and so the difference between the colours isn't great and can be hard to see
# corrplot(lambda.matrix, method = 'color')


# now to export this figure
pdf('../Output_figures/lambda_colour_tables.pdf')
plot(lambda.matrix, col = heat.colors(30, rev = TRUE), breaks = 30, na.col= "black", key = list(side = 1, cex.axis = 1.00), fmt.key="%.3f", xlab = "Independent Variable", ylab = "Dependent Variable", main = "", axis.col = list(side = 3))
plot(lambda.matrix, col = heat.colors(30, rev = TRUE), breaks = 30, na.col= "black", key = list(side = 1, cex.axis = 1.00), fmt.key="%.3f", xlab = "Independent Variable", ylab = "Dependent Variable", main = "", axis.col = list(side = 3), fmt.cell='%.3f')
dev.off()
```

Perhaps unsurprisingly, we can see that the lambda value is more related to the dependent variable than the independent variable (similar values across rows but not necessarily across columns). This makes sense as the lambda value of the correlation comes from the residuals of the line (usually calculated in the vertical direction only) rather than absolute distance from the line.


## Symmetrical Data Plots

Now to use the lambda values to determine which of the duplicate r-values (from reciprocal models eg. MH-SLA and SLA-MH correlations) we're going to use to make the network diagram less busy, more comparable and the correlation coefficient matrix symmetrical for the ellipse table. This requires choosing which variable would be best to be the (in)dependent variable for each comparison and choosing the corresponding model. We decided that the it is more conservative to consider the model for which the lambda value was higher because meant that more of the possibly-interfering phylogenetic signal in both traits was being accounted for (usually when the more phylogenetically conserved (i.e. higher lambda value) trait was the dependent variable).


### Halving the pgls data

So now we will try to make a matrix of both lambda and r-2 such that only the arrangement of dep-indep variables with the highest lambda is included in the eventual matrix.

If we can make a logical matrix or data frame such that the entries of lambda are larger than their reciprocal then maybe have a blank matrix of zeros and have the entries in the position of that logical vector be replaced by the lambda matrix entries. Then we'd have to write another function that replaces the remaining values by adding maybe the transpose of the matrix to itself. lets see if that works.

Turns out there's an upper.tri(m) function for creating a logical that extracts the halves excluding the main diagonal unless diag = TRUE.

```{r}
# In order to determine which models have higher lambda than their reciprocal relationships (i.e. where the (in)dependent variables are swapped around)
extract_highest_lambda <- function(square.matrix) { 
  # creates a logical vector of which cells in a matrix have values that are higher than those of their reflected positions
  logical <- matrix(NA, dim(square.matrix)[1], dim(square.matrix)[2])
for (i in 1:dim(square.matrix)[1]){
  for (j in 1:dim(square.matrix)[2]) {
     logical[i,j] <- square.matrix[i,j] > square.matrix[j,i]
  }
}
  if (sum(logical == t(logical), na.rm = TRUE) != 0) {
    print("WARNING: some cells are equal to their reciprocal positions!") #delivers warning when there are some that are equal instead of having one cell value be larger or smaller than that of it its reciprocal position in the matrix
  }
  return(logical)
}

# now to apply this to the lambda matrix, note this matrix has rows as dependent variables and cols and independent variables
log1 <- extract_highest_lambda(lambda.matrix)
# to check if there are places where lambda was equal for both arrangements
sum(log1 == t(log1), na.rm = TRUE) #each pair of models with equal values when axes are swapped contributes 2 to this total, hence there is only one model like that
log1 == t(log1) #this reveals where they are in the matrix in case there are any, they will be the 'TRUE' cells

# For an example of what to do if some of them have the same lambda for both arrangements
# ## in this case it appears that leaf mass and relative height are the trait in those 2 models and I'll decide to go with the one with leaf mass as the dependent variable
# log1[7,2] <- TRUE #now they're all mirrored pairs nd I've assigned one of them to be the one we are going to use and the rest are either larger or smaller than one another so it's all good

# Now to create the matrices defining which 50% of our models it was that had the higher lambda value
log1
## the following being zero shows that this matrix is such that it's reciprocal equals its opposite (i.e. mirrored in the diagonal (i.e. transpose) equals its negative (swapped TRUE and FALSE) and we can confirm that)
sum(!log1 != t(log1), na.rm = TRUE) 
log2 <- log1
log2[is.na(log2)] <- FALSE
log3 <- !log1
log3[is.na(log3)] <- FALSE
!log2


# now to create the symmetrical 11 x 11 matrix using only the higher lambda value for both entries this time
lambda.half <- matrix(NA, 11, 11)
lambda.half[log2] <- lambda.matrix[log2]
lambda.half[log3] <- t(lambda.matrix)[log3]
rownames(lambda.half) <- rownames(lambda.matrix)
colnames(lambda.half) <- rownames(lambda.half)

# now to make the matrix of extracted r2 values symmetrical with the same method
matrix.r2.half <- matrix(NA, 11, 11) 
matrix.r2.half[log2] <- t(as.matrix(matrix.table.r2))[log2]
matrix.r2.half[!log2] <- as.matrix(matrix.table.r2)[!log2] 
rownames(matrix.r2.half) <- colnames(matrix.table.r2)
colnames(matrix.r2.half) <- rownames(matrix.r2.half)

# taking the square root of the r2 to generate the r-values before assigning signs
matrix.r.half <- sqrt(matrix.r2.half)

## now to assign signs to the r-values based on the sign of the coefficients
matrix.coeff.half <- matrix(NA, 11, 11)
matrix.coeff.half[log2] <- t(as.matrix(matrix.table.c))[log2]
matrix.coeff.half[!log2] <- as.matrix(matrix.table.c)[!log2] 
rownames(matrix.coeff.half) <- colnames(matrix.table.c)
colnames(matrix.coeff.half) <- rownames(matrix.coeff.half)

neg.slopes.half <- matrix.coeff.half < 0

matrix.r.half[neg.slopes.half] <- matrix.r.half[neg.slopes.half]*-1
```


### New Lambda Matrix

```{r, fig.height = 8, fig.width = 10}
# new symmetrical lambda matrix
plot(lambda.half, col = heat.colors(30, rev = TRUE), breaks = 30, na.col= "black", key = list(side = 1, cex.axis = 1.00), fmt.key="%.3f", xlab = "", ylab = "", main = "", axis.col = list(side = 3), asp = TRUE)
# plot(lambda.half, col = heat.colors(10, rev = TRUE), breaks = c(0.400, 0.450, 0.500, 0.550, 0.600, 0.650, 0.700, 0.750, 0.800, 0.850, 0.900), na.col= "black", key = list(side = 1, cex.axis = 1.00), fmt.key="%.3f", xlab = "", ylab = "", main = "", axis.col = list(side = 3), asp = TRUE)
#corrplot(as.matrix(delta.r2.half), method = 'color')

#compare with raw lambda matrix when both plotted in same action
plot(lambda.matrix, col = heat.colors(30, rev = TRUE), breaks = 30, na.col= "black", key = list(side = 1, cex.axis = 1.00), fmt.key="%.3f", xlab = "", ylab = "", main = "", axis.col = list(side = 3), asp = TRUE)
#corrplot(as.matrix(delta.r2), method = 'color')
```

### Symmetrical Network

```{r}
# so for the comparison of the new network diagram with the previous, we can see it has removed the duplicated edges that were there in the previous version
qgraph(matrix.r.half, layout = 'spring', label.cex = 0.9, label.scale = FALSE)
qgraph(matrix.r, layout = 'spring', label.cex = 0.9, label.scale = FALSE)


# TO EXPORT IF DESIRED:

# network.diagram.pgls.half <- qgraph(matrix.r.half, layout = 'spring', label.cex = 0.9, label.scale = FALSE)
# # network.diagram.olm <- qgraph(table.matrix, layout = 'spring', label.cex = 0.9, label.scale = FALSE)
# 
# qgraph(network.diagram.pgls.half, filetype = 'pdf', filename = "../Output_figures/pgls_network_full", height = 15, width = 20, labels = colnames(matrix.r.half), label.cex = 2)
# #qgraph(network.diagram.olm, filetype = 'pdf', filename = "olm_network", height = 15, width = 20, labels = colnames(table.matrix), label.cex = 2)
```


### Network Fine-tuning

Now to further subset which correlation are most useful to show in our final diagram later (or in the supplementary Figures) and compare the effects of each sub-setting technique on the interpretability and aesthetics of the diagram. 

#### Only Significant Relations

The halved network diagram above is still too busy, so perhaps only showing the relationships that are statistically significant will further reduce the visual complexity. The resulting figure, once combined with the OLS version in the following script/notebook is presented in supplementary Figure S8.

##### Reformatting the data

```{r fig.height = 8, fig.width = 10}
# the following uses a custom function for extracting the P-values from each model
pgls.P <- lapply(traits.list, function(model.list){
  unlist(lapply(model.list, extract_P))
})
class(mh.list)
extract_P(perfect.fit)
pgls.P <- as.data.frame(pgls.P)
colnames(pgls.P) <- colnames(matrix.r)
row.names(pgls.P) <- colnames(pgls.P)
## the following ensures the matrix is around the right way with the row indicating the dependent variable and column the independent variable
pgls.P <- t(pgls.P) 
pgls.P 

# the following tests if small differences in computed values in mirrored positions in the matrix are due to the different ways that functions treat values or actually represent an actual difference (i.e. is the matrix actually symmetrical as we would expect it to remain when we swap the axes? We know lambda is often not equal for reciprocal functions so that tends to skew things)
## the result does not return 'TRUE', so mirrored p-values are not simply computationally different. Hence, the matrix is not symmetrical at all -> hence we need to select the half to use based on how the previous parameters were halved/subsetted
all.equal(pgls.P, t(pgls.P)) 

# selecting which 50% of the p-value matrix we are going to be using corresponding to the ways that the r-values and slopes have been subsetted earlier
pgls.P.half <- matrix(NA, 11, 11) 
pgls.P.half[log2] <- as.matrix(pgls.P)[log2]
pgls.P.half[!log2] <- t(as.matrix(pgls.P))[!log2] 
rownames(pgls.P.half) <- colnames(matrix.r)
colnames(pgls.P.half) <- rownames(pgls.P.half)
pgls.P.half

# First to determine which entries in the matrices are significant (to be used in places where I'm not using the symmetrical tables)
## NOTE these are non-symmetrical
sig.models <- pgls.P < 0.05 

# We have applied the is-significant assignment before we have made the matrix symmetrical here in case we want to have a look at the non-symmetrical version at some point. It's possible to assign significance afterward as well though
row.names(sig.models) <- colnames(sig.models)
sig.models <- sig.models == 1
## the following makes sure the end result will be the right way around (dependent vars as row names), since matrix.table.r2 is the wrong way around (dependent vars as col names)
sig.netlines <- t(matrix.table.r2) 
## now sig.netlines is complete and around the right way
sig.netlines[!sig.models] <- 0 

# now to repeat the symmetry-inducing model-choosing as above and 
sig.only.r2.half <- matrix(NA, 11, 11)
sig.only.r2.half[log2] <- as.matrix(sig.netlines)[log2]
sig.only.r2.half[!log2] <- t(as.matrix(sig.netlines))[!log2]
rownames(sig.only.r2.half) <- rownames(sig.netlines)
colnames(sig.only.r2.half) <- rownames(sig.netlines)

##### Plot

Comparing the sig-only version of the network diagram to the previous that contained all the lines:

```{r}
qgraph(matrix.r.half, layout = 'spring', label.cex = 0.9, label.scale = FALSE)
qgraph(sig.only.r.half, layout = 'spring', label.cex = 0.9, label.scale = FALSE)
```

Saving/Exporting this figure if desired:

```{r}
# network.diag.pgls.sig <- qgraph(sig.only.r.half, layout = 'spring', label.cex = 0.9, label.scale = FALSE)

# qgraph(network.diag.pgls.sig, filetype = 'pdf', filename = "../Output_figures/pgls_network_sig_only", height = 15, width = 20, labels = colnames(matrix.r.half), label.cex = 2)
```


#### Thinning Out Busy Edges

We want to make the relationships that had |r| < 0.30 (equivalent to setting the p-value threshold to en even smaller number than 0.05 or lower) invisible but we don't want the node positions to move as if these relationships had never existed. I.e. we want to make some edges invisible but without changing node positions and without changing the edge widths of the remaining edges. Also, we need our final networks to have a more colorblind-friendly color scheme, so from now on we'll use the "theme = 'colorblind'" argument in each network.

Using the in built argument of the qgraph function 'threshold' and 'minimum' remove edges between nodes with thickness below that value, but the former does so before recalculating all of the relative positions of the nodes as if the missing edges had weighting/strength/width of 0 (which drastically changes the shape of the network), whereas the latter preserves node position but re-scales the apparent width of the edges and sets the new 'zero width' to be the new value making many moderate relationships hard to see. 

```{r}
# need to know which relationships we want to keep first
## note cannot regenerate the effective version of the r-matrix used if the subsetting was done as part of function arguments 'threshold' or 'minimum' rather than pre-making the altered r-matrix accordingly
qgraph(matrix.r.half, layout= 'spring', label.cex = 0.9, label.scale = FALSE, theme = 'colorblind', threshold = 0.30)

# now to remove the lines corresponding to relationships of strength |r| < 0.3
## to alter parameters of a network object, it is more convenient to name the object first
network.edge.rem <- qgraph(matrix.r.half, layout= 'spring', label.cex = 0.9, label.scale = FALSE, theme = 'colorblind')
## note that nodes are numbered in order they appear as columns in the r-matrix, hence we can actually do this programmatically
network.edge.rem$Edgelist$weight[abs(network.edge.rem$Edgelist$weight) <0.3] <- 0

# check that it works as intended
plot(network.edge.rem)
qgraph(matrix.r.half, layout= 'spring', label.cex = 0.9, label.scale = FALSE, theme = 'colorblind')
```

To Export this final version of it if desired:

```{r}
# network.edge.rem$graphAttributes$Nodes$label.cex <- 2
# pdf("../Output_figures/pgls_network_final_r>3.pdf", height = 15, width = 20)
# plot(network.edge.rem)
# dev.off()
```



### Supp. Mat. Tables of Full Coeff.

The following extracts all relevant coefficients of all pgls models and constructs a Table for this raw data, later to be finalised into supplementary Table S7.2.

```{r}
# extract standard error of slope coefficient for each model
## note the following has dependent variables as cols not rows
coeff.SE <- lapply(traits.list, function(model.list){
  unlist(lapply(model.list, extract_SE))
})
coeff.SE <- as.data.frame(coeff.SE)
colnames(coeff.SE) <- colnames(matrix.r)
row.names(coeff.SE) <- colnames(coeff.SE)
coeff.SE <- t(coeff.SE) 

# extract the degrees of freedom for each model, note dependent vars are cols here
pgls.n <- lapply(traits.list, function(model.list){
  unlist(lapply(model.list, extract_n))
})
pgls.n <- as.data.frame(pgls.n)
colnames(pgls.n) <- colnames(matrix.r)
row.names(pgls.n) <- colnames(pgls.n)
pgls.df <- pgls.n
pgls.n <- pgls.df + 2

# the following will be formatted such that DV1_1, DV1_2, etc will be the order so when we use 'unlist()' we need the matrices to have dependent vars as cols (i.e. transpose matrices which have been the 'right' way around and leave the rest)
pgls.combined.param1 <- data.frame('Lambda' = unlist(as.data.frame(t(lambda.matrix))), 'Slope' = paste(unlist(as.data.frame(matrix.table.c)), unlist(as.data.frame(coeff.SE)), sep = " ± "), 'R_Squared' = unlist(as.data.frame(matrix.table.r2)), 'N' = unlist(as.data.frame(pgls.n)), 'P_value' = unlist(as.data.frame(t(pgls.P))))
ind.var <- data.frame('I.V.' = rep(c('MH', 'RH', 'SD', 'RBT', 'SLA', 'LA', 'LM', 'FWW', 'FM', 'SM', 'BOS'), times = 11))
pgls.combined.param1 <- cbind(ind.var, pgls.combined.param1)
```

This is fine but we need to find a way to round the extracted values down to a more reasonable number of decimal places i.e. 3 decimal places. 


#### Fixing Rounding

```{r}
# already loaded this object but I'll rename to preserve original
df <- pgls.combined.param1
df[, 'D.V.'] <- row.names(df)

# create a three column data frame with each component of the 'slope' separated by the space character
sep_slope <- data.frame(do.call('rbind', strsplit(as.character(df$Slope),
                                                  ' ', fixed = TRUE)))
# apply the num_round function to cols 1 and 3 but not 2
sep_slope <- data.frame(sep_slope[2], apply(sep_slope[c(1,3)],2,num_round))

# paste them back together after rounding
sep_slope$Slope <- paste(sep_slope$X1, sep_slope$X2, sep_slope$X3)

# final object binds the two character columns, the new slope and rounds the remaining that need it
df2 <- cbind(df[, c('D.V.', 'I.V.')],
             Lambda = num_round(df$Lambda), 
             Slope = sep_slope$Slope,
             R_squared = num_round(df$R_Squared),
             N = df$N,
             P_value = num_round(df$P_value))

pgls.combined.param2 <- df2

# now to export the final table
write.csv(pgls.combined.param2, file = "../Output_figures/PGLS_full_coefficients.csv", row.names = FALSE)
```
